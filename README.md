A 2D JRPG written with SpriteKit and Swift. Hopefully.

So back in high school I managed to convince the teachers that,
for my independent research project, I would program a video game.
Specifically, _An Object-Oriented Approach To a Role-Playing Game
Battle System_. I then proceeded to play (and watch my brother play)
hours of PS1-era Final Fantasy and wrote a very simple battle system
in command-line C++. The next year I (unsuccessfully) attempted to
port it to Java. And then I gave up and [put the whole thing on
SourceForge][dagora].

For some reason, I've decided to modernize the thing and get it on
the iPhone. Thus, this project. I have no idea how well this will
work out, but for whatever it's worth, here we go.

I'm oddEvan and I approve this message.
