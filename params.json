I then proceeded to play (and watch my brother play)\r\nhours of PS1-era Final Fantasy and wrote a very simple battle system\r\nin command-line C++. The next year I (unsuccessfully) attempted to\r\nport it to Java. And then I gave up and [put the whole thing on\r\nSourceForge][dagora].\r\n\r\n[dagora]: http://sourceforge.net/projects/dagora/files/dagora/Dagora%20Battle%20System%20%28Initial%20release%20v0.1%29/\r\n[thesis]: dagora_thesis.pdf\r\n\r\nFor some reason, I've decided to modernize the thing and get it on\r\nthe iPhone. Thus, this project. I have no idea how well this will\r\nwork out, but for whatever it's worth, here we go.\r\n\r\nI'm oddEvan and I approve this message.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
