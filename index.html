<p>So back in high school I managed to convince the teachers that,
for my independent research project, I would program a video game.
Specifically, <em>An Object-Oriented Approach To a Role-Playing Game
Battle System</em>. I then proceeded to play (and watch my brother play)
hours of PS1-era Final Fantasy and wrote a very simple battle system
in command-line C++. The next year I (unsuccessfully) attempted to
port it to Java. And then I gave up and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dagora/files/dagora/Dagora%20Battle%20System%20%28Initial%20release%20v0.1%29/">put the whole thing on
SourceForge</a>.</p>

<p>For some reason, I've decided to modernize the thing and get it on
the iPhone. Thus, this project. I have no idea how well this will
work out, but for whatever it's worth, here we go.</p>

<p>I'm oddEvan and I approve this message.</p>
